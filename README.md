SQLAlchemy

Motivation:

Building a strong database backend has become a very common task for programmers. It has not been an easy task to write raw SQL statements, run them and store the results as an array of records. This method has not only been tedious but prone to various errors. However, programmers today can write Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) programs to avoid this outdated method of using data from databases when using any object-oriented programming language. ORM is a programming technique that converts data between incompatible systems in object-oriented programming languages. The SQLAlchemy library takes part in solving this problem many programmers have faced in the past while using Python. SQLAlchemy’s ORM includes a method of relating user-defined Python classes with database tables as well as instances of those classes with rows in their corresponding tables. This library is similar to sqlite3 in some things; however, SQLAlchemy’s code is distinguishable as it is more object-oriented and easier to read and keep. Besides, one can easily create, read, update and delete SQLAlchemy objects as if they were normal Python objects. We believe this library would bring upon our classmates and us an additional set of skills to simplify our tasks when working with databases, which is why it is important for us all to know about it, and to use our time more efficiently.
